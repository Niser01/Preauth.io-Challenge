# Preauth.io-Challenge

Here are the 2 challenges made by Preauth.io. The first game consist in getting the fist 2 numbers of the array that when they are added it will get the numbner N that is also given by the user. This code was made in Python3, and has a runtime of O(n^2) since it has 2 bucles cheking the array for the values of the addition.

The second challege was to refactor a spaguetti code and add a functionality, given by the user, in this case it was made with Typescript, ans has a rintime of O(n).
