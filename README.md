# Preauth.io-Challenge

Here are the 2 challenges made by Preauth.io. 

The first game consist in getting the fist 2 numbers of the given array. that when the numbers are added the result will be equal to th number N that is given by the user. This code was made in Python3, and has a runtime of O(n^2) since it has 2 for loops cheking the array for the values of the addition.

The second challege was to refactor a spaguetti code and add a functionality given by the user, in this case the code was made with Typescript, and has a runtime of O(n) since it has a for loop that allows to chech the full array.
